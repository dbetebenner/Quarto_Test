The construction of data visualisation will be accompanied with R code using the ggplot2 package. The R code and data used will be provided so participants can fully replicate the presented data visualisations.\nParticipants are expected to know how to use R. Some knowledge in tidyverse would be beneficial. You can find an interactive introduction to data analysis with R at https://learnr.numbat.space/."
